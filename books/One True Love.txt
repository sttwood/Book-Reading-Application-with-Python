"One True Love" by Malinda
	Princes and princesses and true love are all staples of the high fantasy genre. In "One True Love," a little princess is born in the midst of tragedy. Even worse, a prophecy at her birth foretells that if she ever finds her elusive "one true love," it shall be the downfall of the king. And if you've ever read a princess story before, you already know that prophecies are not so easily prevented. Malinda Lo, the author of Ash, is known for her retellings that challenge the status quo, and if that sounds like something up your alley, you'll be hooked on this story and her novels.

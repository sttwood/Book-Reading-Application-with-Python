My love of father and mother
	My mother was struggling with a heart problem and I lived with her for one week while my father was away on a business trip. He was due back yesterday and while we were sitting in the kitchen waiting for him, I noticed how beautiful she looked, despite being so thin and pale. There was a serene expression on her face, but her hands were shaking. Suddenly, we heard the lock turn and my mother jumped up and ran to my father, embraced him tearfully, and mumbled something into his shoulder. He hugged her in return and I just stood there, watching them and smiling. My father’s love is my mother’s greatest remedy.

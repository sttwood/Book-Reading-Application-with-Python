'The Snow Train' by Ken Liu
	"The Snow Train" is a departure from kings and princesses in far away realms. And by that I mean, it's set in Boston. A story about snow and magical transit systems (and a little bit about the American Dream), The Snow Train takes one young boy from his foster home to a very surreal train ride. It'll put you in a very particular mood — one that you won't be able to break free from for quite a while.

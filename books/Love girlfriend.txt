Love girlfriend
	I’m sterile. I kept it from my first girlfriend for a long time because I was afraid that she would leave me. When I finally told her, she actually did leave. I was depressed for a year and my other relationships all led to nothing. About 6 months ago, I met a girl and fell madly in love, but I was afraid to tell her. Yesterday, I told her everything and she just looked at me and said that we could adopt in the future. I was so relieved that I started crying and I knew then that I wanted to marry her.
